# Exercise 1: Contacts List
Hello, awesome people! In this exercise we are building a list with contacts. 

## What you need to achieve


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `server` or dev-server

Contacts list app is fetching data from the glitch server app here: [https://voogie.glitch.me/contacts](https://voogie.glitch.me/contacts)
If by some reason data isn't available, I encourage you to use local *dev-server*
To start local *dev-server* run `npm run dev-server` from the project root folder and make sure that in your application
you're using the following URL: *http://localhost:8686/people*.
