# Exercise 1: Contacts List
Hello, awesome people! In this exercise we are building a list with contacts. The only thing you need to do in order to achieve the goal is to remember all we were talking about during our _intro_ sessions and *fill* or *fix* missed or broken parts of code. 

I used comments in the code so pay attention ðŸ‘€ 

### Note: As a part of homework I assume you will figure out how to get data from the server. Styles and class names are provided so you don't need to design anything, but keep in mind if you wish to add something of your own, like another component, more style or somehow improve this project, feel free to do so ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## What you need to achieve
This is how the app was looking before I ruined everything ...

1.  App starts with a list of available contacts:
[List of Contacts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voogieJames/react-101/exercise1/snapshots/step1.png)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### server and dev-server

Contacts list app is fetching data from the glitch server app here: [https://voogie.glitch.me/contacts](https://voogie.glitch.me/contacts)
If by some reason data isn't available, I encourage you to use local *dev-server*
To start local *dev-server* run `npm run dev-server` from the project root folder and make sure that in your application
you're using the following URL: *http://localhost:8686/people*.
